# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Run Instructions
1. Clone repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` in order to ensure that all the dependencies are installed.
3. To run the server and see any changes made run: `npm run dev`
4. To shutdown the server use `Control C`
